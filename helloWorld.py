# This file is used to print the age of a user after they have entered their 
# age in the terminal.
'''
To ensure that the user enters their age in the terminal we use the 
input() function.
The input() function takes a string as an argument, which is the prompt that 
the user will see.
The input() function then returns the string that the user entered.
'''
age = input("Welcome to the age printer!How old are you? :")

print(age)
